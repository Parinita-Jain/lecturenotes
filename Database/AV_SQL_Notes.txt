We can do indexing in mysql..and there are 2 things to remember..first it is has tobe done on one col at a time.Is the querry to search becomes fast
on whichever colyou have indexed.

For,eg. if we doindexing on id field... sowe can dolike... select * from players where id>=20;it will be very quick.. because it won't scan entire table,
but just id.The thing here tonote is if we have indexing on nae,then we can do ver fast querying on name,like selecting name like Anna or doing some regexp.
but it wont give fast queries on other cols.

Now,because I can make searching faster with indexing, thenI can make allthe cols index,the problem is the more you do indexing,the more your insertion time
increase. Also,themore u do indexing,the more space it takeson your hard disk annd ram.

# which jersey no.is the luckiest?

# here wee first need toknow what lucky means-- is it the players who wear this get highest wage,or they have highest rating or highest market value?

# so being lucky is subjective and giving ans is also subjective,but we need to find ans,so in such cases,u assume something and try tofind the ans,
also inform these assumptions to stakeholders.

# lets say we assume,the player who wear tis no.has the highest total wage.
